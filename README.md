# Code Quiz

## **Introduction**

For this project, my aim was to create a web page that allowed users to complete a timed Coding Quiz.   

## **User Story**

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## **Acceptance Criteria** 

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
